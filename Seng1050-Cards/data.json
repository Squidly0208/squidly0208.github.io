This creates two main problems:\n1.  **Inefficiency in data updates:** If data ever changes (e.g., product categories on a shopping site), every single HTML file using that data would have to be updated, which is inefficient and time-consuming.\n2.  **Inconsistent visual styling:** HTML is only intended to specify structure and semantics, but browsers may visualize elements differently. There's no explicit way to specify visual characteristics to ensure consistency across all browsers.\n\nThe solution for the first problem (separating structure from data) is **Extensible Markup Language (XML)**, which we will learn today. The solution for the second problem (explicitly specifying visual characteristics) is **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)**.",

To remove common 'double borders' (where table, `th`, and `td` elements each have their own borders), use `border-collapse: collapse;` on the `<table>` element. `border-style` can also be used, with `hidden` overriding adjacent styles.\n*   **Column Width:** `width` and `height` properties suggest minimum sizes. The `<colgroup>` element, placed after the `<caption>` but before `<thead>`, is useful for assigning styles (like `width`) to all columns efficiently without repeating styles for each `<td>` tag (e.g., `<col style=\"width:40%\">`).\n\nOther properties like `empty-cells`, `table-layout` (auto/fixed), `text-align`, and `vertical-align` can also be used.",

      "back": "The problem with browser default styles is that the **styles not explicitly specified in CSS still use browser defaults**, resulting in a partial mix of semantics and styling. Since different browsers have varying defaults for HTML elements in their internal stylesheets, this can cause webpages to **look different across different browsers**, leading to visual inconsistencies.\n\nA **CSS Reset** addresses this by being an external CSS file linked in the HTML document's `<head>` that **overrides all default browser styles**, making most HTML elements look identical initially. This gives the developer full control over styling, ensuring consistent presentation and user experience across platforms. The CSS reset is typically the first external CSS linked, so custom styles can be applied on top of it.",
